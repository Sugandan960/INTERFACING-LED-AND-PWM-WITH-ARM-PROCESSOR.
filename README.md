# INTERFACING LED AND PWM, WITH LPC1768 ARM PROCESSOR.

# AIM:    
   To write an embedded c program to interface LED and PWM with ARM processor          LPC1768
          
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
##  HARDWARE:
ARM LPC1768
LED
## SOFTWARE:
KEIL MICRO VISION 4.0 IDE

# PROCEDURE:


⮚	Open the Keil software and select the New uvision project from Project Menu as shown below.
⮚	Browse to your project folder and provide the project name and click on save.

⮚	Once the project is saved a new pop up “Select Device for Target” opens, Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) from NXP (founded by philips) and click on OK.
⮚	Select the controller (NXP: LPC1768) and click on OK.

⮚	As LPC1768 needs the startup code, click on Yes option to include the LPC17xx Startup file.

⮚	Create a new file by file → new to write the program.
 
⮚	Type the code.

⮚	After typing the code save the file as main.c eg. (abc.c).

⮚	Right click target and Add the suitable files to source group1 and header for the project.

⮚	Add the main.c along with system_LPC17xx.c.

⮚	Build the project and fix the compiler errors/warnings if any.

⮚	Code is compiled with no errors. The .bin file is still not generated.

⮚	Right Click on Target Options to select the option for generating .bin file.

⮚	Set IROM1 start address as 0x2000. Bootloader will be stored from 0x0000-0x2000 so application should start from 0x2000
⮚	Write	the	command	to	generate	the .bin file	from
.axf file
Command: fromelf --bin projectname.axf --output filename.bin
⮚	in c/c++ → include paths → desktop (00-libfiles).
⮚	.Bin file is generated after a rebuild.
⮚	Check the project folder for the generated .Bin file. ADD FILES:

# ADD FILES:
Target1:
Source group1:
Startuplpc17xx.s, delay.c , gpio.c , pwm.c , sysytemlpc17xx.c, main.c
Header:
 delay.h, gpio.h, pwm.h, stdulils.h
